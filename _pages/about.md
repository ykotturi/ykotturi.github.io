I am a Ph.D. Student of Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie-Mellon University.

I am advised by [Chinmay Kulkarni](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chinmayk/). My current research projects include:

Supporting Early-Stage Design Feedback Exchanges among Small Business Owners
#### Receiving feedback on open-ended creative work is essential for success. Receiving early-stage feedback often leads to higher quality results by increasing iteration. However, when designers in the "wild" seek feedback, the majority do so towards a later stage in their design process. Moreover, online communities geared towards sharing in-progress work often fail. In this project, we explore why designers wait to ask for feedback until later in their design process. We've found designers viewed both stages being similarly valuable, but opt for late-stage feedback because the design space is larger and less defined, which makes the "script" for early-stage feedback less clear in practice, leading participants to avoid it. Furthermore, participants had misunderstandings regarding idea selection and the prototype fidelity necessary to elicit effective feedback. This project is a collaboration with Prof [Sarah Fox](https://www.sarahfox.info/), [Prototype PGH](https://prototypepgh.com/) a local markerspace in Pittsburgh as well as McKayla Kingston, Director UX Research at [Etsy](https://etsy.com) and the Creator Team at [Instagram](https://instagram.com).

Building a More Inclusive Future of Expert Crowd Work
#### To stay competitive in today's tech job market requires constant re-skilling and "up-skilling", to out run not only human competitors, but also machine competition--yes the robots are coming! The burden of re-skilling often falls onto the shoulders workers, and this burden is often heightened in online labor markets (freelancing such as [Upwork](https://upwork.com), crowdsourcing such as [AMT](https://www.mturk.com/)) where workers often lack support systems more readily found in traditional jobs. At the same time, workers continue to flock these online labor platforms, with some estimates projecting freelance, or contigent, workers will comprise 40% of U.S. laborforce in 2025. In this project, we are taking a participatory design approach to shaping tools and curriculum to facilitate local technical job mobility within the Pittsburgh area. This project is a collaboration with Prof [Jeff Bigham](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/) and a local co-working space [Community Forge](https://www.forge.community/), located in Wilkinsburg, PA.

Reimagining Online Hiring, at Large Scale
#### Expert crowdsourcing (e.g., Upwork.com) provides promising benefits such as productivity improvements for employers, and flexible working arrangements for workers. Yet to realize these benefits, a key persistent challenge is effective hiring at scale. Current approaches, such as reputation systems and standardized competency tests, develop weaknesses such as score inflation over time, thus degrading market quality. This project explores a novel alternative approach to hiring at scale that leverages peer assessment to elicit honest assessments of fellow workers' job application materials, which it then aggregates using an impartial ranking algorithm. This project is a collaboration with Prof [Ariel Proccacia](http://procaccia.info/).

<!--  Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
