I am a postdoc at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, working with [Jeff Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/).

I am currently a postdoc in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University working with [Jeffrey Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/). I received my Ph.D. from the HCII in 2022 and completed my dissertation, ["Community-Based Approaches to Building Peer Support Systems for Work"](https://ykotturi.github.io/files/ykotturi-hci-phd-2022.pdf) under the supervision of [Chinmay Kulkarni](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chinmayk/).

### Peerdea: Co-Designing a Peer Support Platform with Creative Entrepreneurs

Yasmine Kotturi, Jenny Yu, Pranav Khadpe, Harvey Zheng, Erin Gatz, Sarah Fox, Chinmay Kulkarni

In this paper, we describe a multi-year partnership with a local feminist makerspace to build a social platform, called Peerdea, which centered creative entrepreneurs' needs such that online feedback and information exchange, and goal setting and accountability were more readily available to them. Through an iterative, community-collaborative approach with 46 creative entrepreneurs, we report on the kinds of peer support entrepreneurs sought on Peerdea such as feedback on in-progress and unpolished work.

  Creative entrepreneurs join makerspaces to build relationships with vetted and trustful peers over time. Yet, as makerspaces increasingly use social technologies to connect members online, such technological adoption is often incongruent with the unique needs of creative entrepreneurs such as safeguarding their reputation and intellectual property.  In this paper, we describe a multi-year partnership with a local feminist makerspace to build a social platform, called Peerdea, which centered creative entrepreneurs' needs such that online feedback and information exchange, and goal setting and accountability were more readily available to them.  Through an iterative, community-collaborative approach with 46 creative entrepreneurs, we report on the kinds of peer support entrepreneurs sought on Peerdea such as feedback on in-progress and unpolished work. We argue that by aligning the platform's design with the makerspace's community of practice, Peerdea leveraged the relationship and trust building which occurs more readily in-person for entrepreneurs. In addition, we highlight the role of a community mediator who actively managed the relationships between researchers and entrepreneurs, surfaced failures and championed successes, and overall provided a critical link for co-design when participants' livelihoods were implicated.

### Building a More Inclusive Future of Expert Crowd Work
 To stay competitive in today's tech job market requires constant re-skilling and "up-skilling", to out run not only human competitors, but also machine competition--yes the robots are coming! The burden of re-skilling often falls onto the shoulders workers, and this burden is often heightened in online labor markets (freelancing such as [Upwork](https://upwork.com), crowdsourcing such as [AMT](https://www.mturk.com/)) where workers often lack support systems more readily found in traditional jobs.

### Reimagining Online Hiring, at Large Scale
 Expert crowdsourcing (e.g., Upwork.com) provides promising benefits such as productivity improvements for employers, and flexible working arrangements for workers. Yet to realize these benefits, a key persistent challenge is effective hiring at scale. Current approaches, such as reputation systems and standardized competency tests, develop weaknesses such as score inflation over time, thus degrading market quality.

<!--  Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
