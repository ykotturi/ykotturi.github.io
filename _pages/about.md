## I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Human-Centered Computing at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I completed my Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon, under the supervision of [Chinmay Kulkarni](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chinmayk/). More recently, I was Postdoctoral Scholar working with [Jeffrey Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/) in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

<!-- My work focuses on how to design generative AI interfaces to support users with diverse digital literacy needs. Specifically, my research facilitates local entrepreneurs' use of generative AI technologies for their small, product-based businesses.  -->

### Research questions I am curently investigating include:
<li>How do entrepreneurs use (and prefer not to use) generative AI technologies for their business? </li>
<li>How might we build generative AI interfaces and systems to better support minority small business owners?</li>
<li>What is the role of social support when onboarding entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms and features?</li>

### Deconstructing the Veneer of Simplicity: Co-Designing Introductory Generative AI Workshops with Local Entrepreneurs

Yasmine Kotturi, Angel Anderson, Glenn Ford, Michael Skirpan, Jeffrey Bigham

In this paper, we designed an interactive workshops series aimed to onboard local entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms for small business. We detail the importance of communal and supportive exposure to generative
AI tools for local entrepreneurs, scaffolding actionable use (and supporting non-use), demystifying generative AI technologies by emphasizing entrepreneurial power, while simultaneously deconstructing the veneer of simplicity to address the many operational skills needed for successful application.

  Generative AI platforms and features are permeating many aspects of work. Entrepreneurs from lean economies in particular are well positioned to outsource tasks to generative AI given limited resources. In this paper, we work to address a growing disparity in use of these technologies by building on a four-year partnership with a local entrepreneurial hub dedicated to equity in tech and entrepreneurship. Together, we co-designed an interactive workshops series aimed to onboard local entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms. Alongside four community-driven and iterative workshops with entrepreneurs across five months, we conducted interviews with 15 local entrepreneurs and community providers. We detail the importance of communal and supportive exposure to generative AI tools for local entrepreneurs, scaffolding actionable use (and supporting non-use), demystifying generative AI technologies by emphasizing entrepreneurial power, while simultaneously deconstructing the veneer of simplicity to address the many operational skills needed for successful application.

### Peerdea: Co-Designing a Peer Support Platform with Creative Entrepreneurs

Yasmine Kotturi, Jenny Yu, Pranav Khadpe, Harvey Zheng, Erin Gatz, Sarah Fox, Chinmay Kulkarni

In this paper, we describe a multi-year partnership with a local feminist makerspace to build a social platform, called Peerdea, which centered creative entrepreneurs' needs such that online feedback and information exchange, and goal setting and accountability were more readily available to them. Through an iterative, community-collaborative approach with 46 creative entrepreneurs, we report on the kinds of peer support entrepreneurs sought on Peerdea such as feedback on in-progress and unpolished work.

Creative entrepreneurs rely on online platforms to build community in order to overcome isolated work
conditions. However, because of frequent attempts by larger brands to use their work without permission,
creative entrepreneurs constrain their use of social platforms in order to safeguard their intellectual property.
In this paper, we describe a multi-year partnership with a feminist makerspace to build a social platform, called
Peerdea, that centered creative entrepreneurs’ needs such that online feedback and information exchange, and goal setting and accountability were more readily available to them. Through an iterative, community-
collaborative approach with 46 creative entrepreneurs, we report on the kinds of peer support entrepreneurs
sought on Peerdea such as feedback on in-progress and unpolished work. We argue that by aligning Peerdea’s
design with the makerspace’s community of practice, Peerdea leveraged the relationship and trust building
which occurs more readily in person for entrepreneurs. In addition, we highlight the role of a community
leader who actively managed the relationships between researchers and entrepreneurs, surfaced failures and
championed successes, and provided critical mediation for co-design when participants’ livelihoods were
implicated.

### Exploring the Role of Social Support when Integrating Generative AI in Small Business Workflows

Quentin Romero Lauro, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Yasmine Kotturi

We interviewed 11 entrepreneurs and support personnel to detail how entrepreneurs resourcefully leveraged their local networks to discover new use-cases of generative AI (e.g., by sharing accounts), assuage heightened techno-anxieties (e.g., by recruiting trusted confidants), overcome barriers to sustained use (e.g., by receiving wrap-around support), and establish boundaries of use.

Small business owners stand to benefit from generative AI technologies due to limited resources, yet they must navigate increasing legal and ethical risks. In this paper, we interview 11 entrepreneurs and support personnel to investigate existing practices of how entrepreneurs integrate generative AI technologies into their business workflows. Specifically, we build on scholarship in HCI which emphasizes the role of small, offline networks in supporting entrepreneurs’ technology maintenance. We detail how entrepreneurs resourcefully leveraged their local networks to discover new use-cases of generative AI (e.g., by sharing accounts), assuage heightened techno-anxieties (e.g., by recruiting trusted confidants), overcome barriers to sustained use (e.g., by receiving wrap-around support), and establish boundaries of use. Further, we suggest how generative AI platforms may be redesigned to better support entrepreneurs, such as by taking into account the benefits and tensions
of use in a social context.

### Sustaining Community-Based Research in Computing: Lessons from Two Tech Capacity Building Initiatives for Local Businesses

Yasmine Kotturi and Julie Hui (shared first authorship), TJ Johnson, Lutalo Sanifu, Tawanna Dillahunt

Drawing on two multi-year programs for small-scale tech capacity building in post-industrial U.S. cities, this article presents a comparative analysis and retrospective ethnography to investigate the challenges and strategies for sustained community-based research in computing. In particular, our work aimed to better understand and contribute the necessary considerations and dynamics among the academic-community partnerships attributed to sustaining the community-based programs over time.

The field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has traditionally focused on the design of novel technology
artifacts. However, ensuring considerations for artifact maintenance and repair is crucial to sustainably
supporting the populations they aim to serve over the long term. Drawing on two multi-year programs for
tech capacity building in post-industrial U.S. cities, this article presents a comparative analysis to investigate
the challenges and strategies for sustained community-based research in computing. In particular, our work
detailed three considerations for academic-community partnerships. First, long-term partnerships prioritized
transferring trust across academic and community personnel and continually set expectations that responded
to evolving community initiatives (i.e., relational sustainability). Second, partnerships used academic support
as a way to kickstart community initiatives, and flexibly reframed interventions to stay aligned with evolving
community goals (i.e., economic sustainability). Third, partnerships trained personnel to provide technical
support alongside interventions and prioritized advice that resisted short-term trends (i.e., technical sustain-
ability). We provide concrete examples of how our two academic-community partnerships carried out such
suggestions—such details go unreported in scholarly articles yet are essential for sustainability considerations.
We discuss ongoing challenges, such as rethinking when longevity should and should not be the end goal.

### Tech Help Desk: Support for Local Entrepreneurs Addressing the Long Tail of Computing Challenges

Yasmine Kotturi, TJ Johnson, Michael Skirpan, Sarah E Fox, Jeffrey P Bigham, Amy Pavel

 Even entrepreneurs whose businesses are not technological (e.g., handmade goods) need to be able to use a wide range of computing technologies in order to achieve their business goals. In this paper, we follow a participatory action research approach and collaborate with various stakeholders at an entrepreneurial co-working space to design “Tech Help Desk”, an on-going technical service for entrepreneurs, which has been running for over four years.

In this paper, we follow a participatory action research approach and collaborate with various stakeholders at an entrepreneurial co-working space to design “Tech Help Desk”, an on-going technical service for entrepreneurs. Our model for technical assistance is strategic, in how it is designed to fit the context of local entrepreneurs, and responsive, in how it prioritizes emergent needs. From our engagements with 19 entrepreneurs and support personnel, we reflect on the challenges with existing technology support for non-technological entrepreneurs. Our work highlights the importance of ensuring technological support services can adapt based on entrepreneurs’ ever-evolving priorities, preferences and constraints. Furthermore, we find technological support services should maintain broad technical support for entrepreneurs’ long tail of computing challenges.

<!--  Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
